# Start of Reactjs 

in the react folder structure index.html file is available ehat is the use of that file??

It contains a <div id="root"> where the entire React app gets rendered.
React dynamically updates this div using the Virtual DOM.
The index.html file includes <script> and <link> tags to load JavaScript and CSS files.
